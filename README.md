# Overview

## The Challenge
Build a Node.js command line applications that takes in user inputs to generate an SVG Logo and saves it as a "logo.svg" file in the examples folder of the application.

## User Story

As a freelance web developer
I Want to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria

## Installation Process
1. Clone the Repository: []
2. Run NPM Install to install the packages needed
3. Open the repository in any source code editor. Gitbash, Terminal, etc.
4. Open the integrated terminal and run node index.js and proceed to follow the instructions.

## What I Learned

I learned how to better use switch cases in my code. I had previously tried using switch cases in a previous assignment and wasn't able to get it running well enough then. After writing most of the code here I had run into too many errors and decided to go back to the drawing board and watched a few videos on switch cases and was able to impliment them better here.

## Continued Deployment

I could definitely add more features to the code and more shapes and symbols. I was thinking about uniting a few pages to make it easier to navigate but I prefer having more pages with more exports going on.
